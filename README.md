# scala-ember-14

A small Scala tool that computes text statistics for ember.

## Objective

- Report top word frequencies for fast inspection.

## Use cases

- Summarize ember notes when preparing reports.

## Usage
scala Main.scala data/sample.txt --top 5

## Output
- lines: total line count
- words: total word count
- chars: total character count
- top words: most frequent tokens (case-insensitive)

## Testing
